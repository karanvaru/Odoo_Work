                  <field name="faq_question">How and when can I claim my reward?</field>
                  <field name="faq_answer">The reward is a refund on your credit card after your friend has completed their stay. A few days after your friend has checked out of their booked accommodation, an email is sent to you on claiming your reward. To receive your reward, you need to have a Booking.com account or sign up for one. Then all you need to do is register your credit card details on your account. If you have registered more than one credit card, simply let us know which card we should send your reward to with our tickbox option. If you have already supplied your credit card details on your account and have clicked our tickbox option, we will send the reward automatically and no further action is required. You should receive your reward within seven working days after giving us your card details (unless your friend has not checked out).</field>
