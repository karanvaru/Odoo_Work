                        Dear ${object.partner_id.name},
                        <br /><br />
                         I am writing to you regarding ticket ${object.id} I recently merged two separate tickets into one and wanted to make sure that you have all the information you need to address the issue.<br />
                         The two tickets that were merged were: <br />
                         - Main Ticket ${object.id} <br />
                         - Merged Ticket ${'id_list' in ctx and ctx['id_list'] or '' | safe}  <br />
                         <br />
                           The reason for the merge was that both tickets were related to the same issue, and would be easier and faster to trace and resolve if all the information was in one place.
                            If you have any questions or concerns about the merge, please do not hesitate to contact us. <br />
                         <br />
                         Thank you for your time.<br></br>

                         Yours sincerely,<br></br>
