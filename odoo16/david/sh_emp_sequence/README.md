About
============
It's difficult to manage lots of employees without a unique sequence number. This module auto-generates the employee number sequence. You can change patterns in employee sequence numbers. When you create a new employee, the sequence number assigned automatically. You can allocate multiple employee sequence numbers in a single click.

1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
